title: "Arachne/Security - Simplified Authorizator and Fixed ACL Callbacks"
perex: |
    Authorization in [Nette/Security](https://github.com/nette/security) has some long-known drawbacks as demonstrated in my 4 years old [RFC](https://forum.nette.org/cs/13458-security-iauthorizator-a-identita) (Czech only).
    This article will show you how you can solve these problems using the enhanced API provided by [Arachne/Security](https://github.com/Arachne/Security).

## Simplified Authorizator

The problems in Nette/Security are that authorization is tied too tightly to `Nette\Security\User` and lacks proper API for ownership-based ACL permissions. The RFC was not accepted in the end but in the comments [David Grudl](https://github.com/dg) suggested a [new API](https://forum.nette.org/cs/13458-security-iauthorizator-a-identita#p99180) for Authorizator. It was never implemented in Nette itself but Arachne/Security is an implementation of that proposal.

Arachne/Security introduces a new interface `Arachne\Security\Authorization\AuthorizatorInterface`. The `isAllowed()` method is simplified to just resource and privilege. Implementations of this interface should use `Arachne\Security\Authentication\FirewallInterface` (Arachne equivalent of `Nette\Security\User` - read my [previous article](/blog/2017/08/14/arachne-security-separate-authentication-and-session-refresh) for details) to get the user's identity. This way you can have multiple different authorizators for each firewall.

Here is an example of how to register and implement the authorizator.

```yaml
services:
    admin.authorizator.factory: App\Module\AdminModule\Security\AuthorizatorFactory
    admin.authorizator:
        factory: @admin.authorizator.factory::create
        tags:
            arachne.security.authorizator: admin
```

```php
namespace App\Module\AdminModule\Security;

use App\Module\AdminModule\Security\AdminFirewall;
use Arachne\Security\Authentication\FirewallInterface;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\AuthorizatorInterface;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\Permission;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\PermissionAuthorizator;

class AuthorizatorFactory
{
    /**
     * @var AdminFirewall
     */
    private $firewall;

    public function __construct(AdminFirewall $firewall)
    {
        $this->firewall = $firewall;
    }

    public function create(): AuthorizatorInterface
    {
        $permission = new Permission();

        // Setup $permission using addRole, addResource and allow methods.

        return new PermissionAuthorizator($this->firewall, $permission);
    }
}
```


## Fixed permission callbacks in ACL

In the example above you might have noticed that I used `Arachne\Security\Authorization\Permission` instead of `Nette\Security\Permission`. This adresses the core issue from the [RFC](https://forum.nette.org/cs/13458-security-iauthorizator-a-identita) (Czech only) mentioned above. It changes the parameters which will be received by callbacks passed to `allow()` and `deny()` methods. **You can finally implement all permissions that require an identity check the right way** without ugly [hacks](https://forum.nette.org/cs/1231-2009-01-21-sikovnejsi-permission#p70832).

```php
namespace App\Module\AdminModule\Security;

use App\Module\AdminModule\Module\ArticleModule\Entity\Article;
use App\Module\AdminModule\Security\AdminFirewall;
use Arachne\Security\Authentication\FirewallInterface;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\AuthorizatorInterface;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\Permission;
use Arachne\Security\Authorization\PermissionAuthorizator;
use Nette\Security\IResource;

class AuthorizatorFactory
{
    // ...

    public function create(): AuthorizatorInterface
    {
        $permission = new Permission();

        // Setup $permission using addRole, addResource and allow methods.

        // Redactor can only edit his own articles.
        $permission->allow(
            'Redactor',
            Article::class,
            'edit',
            function (IIdentity $identity, IResource $article) {
                return $identity->getId() === $article->getAuthor()->getId();
            }
        );

        return new PermissionAuthorizator($this->firewall, $permission);
    }
}
```


## Wait, there is more!

This is actually just a small portion of how Arachne can help you implement the security layer of your application. There is another package called [Arachne/SecurityVerification](https://github.com/Arachne/SecurityVerification) which integrates Arachne/Security with [Arachne/Verifier](https://github.com/Arachne/Verifier) to **greatly simplify your security layer with annotations and latte macros**. How to do this will be described in the next article.
